                You dont need a degree to become an estate agent. However, if you are interested in working as a surveyor for a large firm, youre likely to be expected to progress towards becoming a chartered surveyor alongside your work. The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors' (RICS) chartership qualification process is called the Assessment of Professional Competence (APC)  this will enable you to carry out full surveys and valuations of properties.
                Some experience of customer service work and an interest in the local property market will be an advantage, as will any studies in relevant subjects such as business, building surveying, real estate or planning and property development.
                Once youre working, you can work towards professional property qualifications. Your employer may expect you to complete these as part of your employment.

There are no formal entry requirements for estate agents in local or independent agencies, and both school leavers and graduates can apply for trainee estate agent/junior estate agent/sales negotiator roles.</p>
